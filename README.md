# ChicagoCrime_Classification

This project consist of Predictive Model that predict for Chicago Crime Type using Ensemble Model of KNN, Random Forest and Neural Network.

The main aim of the project is to predict the Crime type that happened in Chicago using the past historical data. This project served as a proof of concept for framming a Supervised Classification Task using an Ensemble Voting Model consisting KNN, Random Forest and Neural Network. It is one of the mini project during my study in Master of Data Science. Feel free to drop a comment and feedback.
